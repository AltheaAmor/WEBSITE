<h2> HISTORY </h2>
  <p>In December 2006, Mrs. Zaida M. Padullo succeeded<br>
Dr. Lauigan as Officer – In – Charge. Active and young,<br>
the former Administrative Officer of Commonwealth High<br>
School started to implement rules that suited the needs of <br>
the students. She prioritized and gave importance to the <br>
independency of the school. On July 2007, through her efforts, <br>
Commonwealth High School – Holy Spirit Annex became an<br>
independent school and was renamed Holy Spirit National<br>
High School. She reactivated the “Halaman at Gulay sa<br>
Paaralan” project and restricted the school’s organizational<br>
setup. On her first year, she reclassified five (5) Teacher<br>
I positions to Master Teacher I and converted six (6) teacher<br>
items into Head Teachers on her second year.<br>
<br>
<br>
Holy Spirit National High School was created <br>
because of the need to provide quality and accessible<br>
education to students of Barangay Holy Spirit. To deal<br>
with the increasing number of enrollees at Commonwealth<br>
High School, the local government has come up with the<br>
proposal of putting up an annex in the said barangay.<br>
<br>
<br>
At present, Holy Spirit National High School has come<br>
 a long way, from its initial budget of    Ᵽ200,000.00 <br>
 (two hundred thousand pesos), Mrs. Padullo utilized for <br>
 bigger allocation. From Ᵽ200,000.00 in 2006 to Ᵽ1.2M in 2007,<br>
 Ᵽ1.7M in 2008 and Ᵽ2.5M in 2009. It was also during her<br>
 term that 60 new positions were created in addition to the<br>
 existing 25 permanent positions rounding off the total number <br>
 of permanent teachers to 85. This allocation enabled her to make<br>
 significant improvement in the physical facilities of the school<br>
 like the creation of Science Laboratory, Clinic, Practice House,<br>
 and provided teachers with materials needed to improve their instruction.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 On October 2, 2012, after almost six years <br>
 of Mrs. Zaida M. Padullo’s leadership in Holy <br>
 Spirit National High School, she was  transferred <br>
 to Judge Feliciano Belmonte Sr. High School as Principal <br>
 III. Dr. Anita S. Bohol, former Principal of<br>
 Doña Rosario High School took over the position.<br>
 A Ph.D Grduate of New Era University, Dr. Bohol focused <br>
 more on the management of the staff and the teaching personnel.<br>
 Through her leadership, the school almost achieved<br>
 the Zero % drop-out through the implementation of DORP<br>
 (Drop-Out Reduction Programs) such as the Project Citizen<br>
 and Sagip-Bata Program. It was also under her leadership <br>
 that the school was able to increase the NAT results for two consecutive years.
